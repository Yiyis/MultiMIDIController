# MultiMIDIController
This is our Experiment 1 project for Creation & Computation course in OCAD University. We are using 3 light sensors to control MIDI message and communicate with Live 9.

To use this code, just connect 3 light sensors to the 3 analog pins to Feather board (or Arduino). You will also need to download Hairless MIDI Serial to read the MIDI message. And finally set up your Ableton Live 9 to read MIDI message, you are good to go! Have Fun!
